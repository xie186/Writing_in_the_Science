6. Question 6

What is the main problem with the verbs in this passage?

"Chromatographic behavior of some amino acids in aqueous–organic and aqueous modified micellar mobile phases was studied by thin-layer liquid chromatography. Intrinsic basic laws, features, possibilities, and limitations were revealed. It was shown that the efficiency of the chromatographic separation of amino acids in the presence of electrolytes was significantly improved in micellar mobile phases."



-[] The tense of the verbs is inconsistent.



-[] They are boring "to be" verbs.



-[] They are in the passive voice.

> Answer: This answer is correct. The verbs are all in the passive voice (is studied, are revealed, is shown, is improved).

7. Question 7

What is the main verb in the following sentence? (Please enter only one word in the space provided.)

The results of variation of the applied chromatographic conditions, such as the bulk solvent composition, the concentrations and ratio of the acid and base additives, the presence of water as mobile phase additive and the counter-ion concentration furnished a better understanding of the retention mechanism.

> Answer: furnished

8. Question 8

Questions 8-13 may have more than one correct answer. Use your best judgment to infer the author’s intent. Grading is based on completion only. After submission, check your work by comparing your answer with the model answer provided.

Revise the following sentence to reduce the distance between the subject and predicate (main verb) of the sentence:

The results of variation of the applied chromatographic conditions, such as the bulk solvent composition, the concentrations and ratio of the acid and base additives, the presence of water as mobile phase additive and the counter-ion concentration furnished a better understanding of the retention mechanism.


> Answer:   We gained a better understanding of the retention mechanism by varying the applied chromatographic conditions, including the bulk solvent composition, the concentrations and ratios of the acid and base additives, the presence of water as mobile phase additive, and the counter-ion concentration.

9. Question 9

Change the following sentence into the active voice; also revise the sentence for clarity and brevity:

The animal numbers for each group are chosen to achieve an adequate sample size to be able to observe a signal for effect in the behavioral tests.


> Model Answer: We determined the minimum sample size needed to observe a signal in the behavioral tests.

10. Question 10

Change the following sentence into the active voice; also revise the sentence for clarity and brevity:

The validity of self-report of raised nevi over the telephone was evaluated in comparison to dermatological examination among a sub-sample of 25 subjects from the total sample of 100.


>Model Answer: To evaluate the validity of self-report of raised nevi, we administered a skin exam to a quarter of the subjects.

11. Question 11

Revise the following sentence for clarity and brevity:

This suggests that a high priority of providers, managers of health care, and researchers should be the identification and evaluation of approaches to improving the cost-effectiveness of managing the most prevalent chronic disease conditions in the general population.


> Model Answer: Thus, a high priority should be given to identifying and evaluating cost-effective strategies for managing common chronic diseases.

12. Question 12

Revise the following passage for clarity and brevity; also, change all passive voice sentences to the active voice.

We classified injuries as initial or subsequent injuries. An initial injury was defined as the athlete’s first injury incident during the season. Subsequent injury was defined as any injury that occurred after the initial injury, including re-injury to the same body part or a subsequent new injury to a different body part. Total injuries included all injuries recorded, initial and subsequent.

> Model Answer: We subdivided total injuries into initial and subsequent. An initial injury was the athlete’s first injury during the season; a subsequent injury was any that occurred after the initial injury (including re-injury to the same body part).

13. Question 13

Revise the following sentence to fix the buried verb; also improve clarity and brevity:

The lower external joint moments at the knee and hip joints, the lower mechanical work at the knee joint during stance, the lower energy loss in the prosthetic ankle joint, and the lower total body mechanical work in each ground contact that leads to the assumption that running with dedicated prostheses allows the double transtibial amputee sprinter to run at the same level of performance as able-bodied controls, albeit, at lower metabolic costs.

> Model Answer: The prostheses provide the double transtibial amputee sprinter with several advantages that may reduce his metabolic costs relative to able-bodied controls, including: lower external joint moments at the knee and hip, lower energy loss in the ankle joint, and lower mechanical work with each foot strike.
